'''
    Painter classes allow you to get an evolving selection of coordinates, according to the type of painter you use.

    Start it, set size (default: 1), update it as many times you want with new positions on the grid, then
    get the list of selected coordinates, or the list of added / removed coorinates by the last update.

    Connect those functions to your graphical grid, and let it do the job.

    Example of use:
        On mouse left button down on a (x, y) cell: painter.start(x, y)
        On hover event on cells: painter.update(), then display the result on your grid
        On mouse left button up: Apply the modification on your grid, then delete your painter object
